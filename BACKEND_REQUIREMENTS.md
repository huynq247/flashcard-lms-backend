## üéØ Core Requirements Discussion

### 1. üîê Authentication & User Management
**Priority**: HIGH (Foundation for everything)

#### Requirements to discuss:
- [ ] **User Roles**: Student, Teacher, Admin
  - Student: study, view own progress
  - Teacher: Manage classrooms, create decks, assign decks,  view student progress
  - Admin: System management, user management
- [ ] **Authentication Method**: JWT (access + refresh tokens)
- [ ] **Registration Process**: 
  - Simple email/password registration
  - Email verification needed? (discuss)
- [ ] **Password Management**:
  - Password reset via email
  - Password strength requirements
- [ ] **Social Login**: Google OAuth (optional for later)

#### Questions:
1. Do we need email verification for registration?
2. Should we implement classroom/organization management?
3. What user profile information do we need?

### 2. üìö Deck & Flashcard Management
**Priority**: HIGH (Core functionality)

#### Requirements to discuss:
- [ ] **Deck Features**:
  - Create, edit, delete decks
  - Public/private visibility
  - Deck categories and tags
  - Deck sharing (public link or specific users)
- [ ] **Flashcard Features**:
  - Question/answer pairs
  - Optional hint and explanation
  - Text-based content (images later)
  - Difficulty rating (1-5)
- [ ] **Import/Export**:
  - CSV format support
  - JSON export for backup
  - Anki import (future feature)

#### Questions:
1. Should we support multimedia (images, audio) in MVP?
2. Do we need deck collaboration (multiple editors)?
3. What categories should we predefine?

---

### 3. üß† Learning & Study System
**Priority**: HIGH (Core value proposition)

#### Requirements to discuss:
- [ ] **Spaced Repetition System (SRS)**:
  - SM-2 algorithm implementation
  - Automatic scheduling based on performance
  - Manual difficulty adjustment
- [ ] **Study Modes**:
  - Review mode (due cards)
  - Learning mode (new cards)
  - Practice mode (random selection)
- [ ] **Study Sessions**:
  - Track session time and performance
  - Session goals (number of cards, time limit)
  - Progress saving for interrupted sessions

#### Questions:
1. Should we use SM-2 or a simpler algorithm for MVP?
2. Do we need timed study sessions?
3. What performance metrics should we track?

---

### 4. üìä Analytics & Progress Tracking
**Priority**: MEDIUM (Important for engagement)

#### Requirements to discuss:
- [ ] **User Statistics**:
  - Total study time
  - Cards studied count
  - Study streak tracking
  - Learning progress visualization
- [ ] **Deck Statistics**:
  - Usage frequency
  - Average difficulty
  - Success rates
- [ ] **Performance Analytics**:
  - Response time tracking
  - Accuracy trends
  - Learning curve analysis

#### Questions:
1. How detailed should the analytics be in MVP?
2. Do we need real-time progress updates?
3. Should we provide data export for users?

---

### 5. ü§ñ AI Features (Future)
**Priority**: LOW (Nice to have, post-MVP)

#### Potential features to discuss:
- [ ] **Auto-generate flashcards**:
  - From text input
  - From PDF documents
  - From web articles
- [ ] **Smart study recommendations**:
  - Personalized study schedules
  - Difficulty adjustment suggestions
  - Content recommendations
- [ ] **Natural language processing**:
  - Question generation
  - Answer validation
  - Content summarization

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation Discussion

### Database Schema Design
- [ ] **Users Collection**: Authentication, profile, stats
- [ ] **Decks Collection**: Metadata, ownership, sharing
- [ ] **Flashcards Collection**: Content, SRS data, performance
- [ ] **Study Sessions Collection**: Session tracking, analytics
- [ ] **User Progress Collection**: Learning analytics, achievements

### API Endpoints Structure
- [ ] **Authentication**: `/auth/*` (login, register, refresh)
- [ ] **Users**: `/users/*` (profile, stats, preferences)
- [ ] **Decks**: `/decks/*` (CRUD, sharing, search)
- [ ] **Flashcards**: `/flashcards/*` (CRUD, study operations)
- [ ] **Study**: `/study/*` (sessions, reviews, analytics)

### Performance Considerations
- [ ] **Pagination**: For deck lists, flashcard lists
- [ ] **Caching**: User sessions, frequently accessed data
- [ ] **Indexing**: Database queries optimization
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: API protection
